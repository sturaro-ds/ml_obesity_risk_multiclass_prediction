**Overview**

The objective of this competition on Kaggle is to use various factors to predict the risk of obesity in individuals, which is related to cardiovascular diseases.

I performed EDA, pre-processing and applied just one predictive model, Random Forest, with some hyperparameters to seek its best predictive performance.

Random Forest is a supervised learning algorithm in Machine Learning, in short, it will create many decision trees, randomly, forming what we can visualize as a forest, and each tree will be used to define the final result, in a kind of voting.
